# Ackermann in C

So this in an implementation of Ackermann's function, in C.
An Ackermann function is one of the first (or earliest) examples of a function which has to be written with recursion. 

Just as a heads up, the big crunch will come before `m = 4, n = 2` completes.

## Build and Run
Build command - `clang main.c -o program` where `-o` is what you want t call the compiled program.

Run command - `./program`

Easy.

## Future enhancements
I might add a timer ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
